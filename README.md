# **kickstarter-analysis**
## Overview of Project
This report consists of two primary campaign visualization outcomes based on Launch date and funding goals. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis here is to discover how different campaigns fared based on Launch date and funding goals outcomes for Louise, so she can be more prepared before launching her new business idea.  
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The chart clear illustrate two things. For one, we can see that successful campaigns have much higher fundraising goals in the early months of the year and reached the peak in May. Then it was gradually decreasing towards the end of the year. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

By reviewing this line chat, we can see that there is a completely symmetrical relationship between successful and failed outcomes based on their goals. And it happens at 50% threshold. Overall, the lower amount of goal the higher percentage of the successful projects and vice versa.  
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Since the result outcome for both successful and failed campaigns complete the opposite, it can be hard to tell what else the factor is there to keep people unsuccessful from their projects.
## Recommandation and Limitation
Based on the findings, we could recommend that the best date for Louise to launch her play should probably happen at the beginning of the year. In addition, there are couple of limitation, for one is that the percentage applied here prevents the accurate number of outcomes. Another one is that the data collected in all different countries between 2009 and 2017, therefore, some of information might not be validated because of the currency rates.  We probably also need to look at measures of central tendency to see how the data is distributed. The following chart is based on U.S. Therefore, If Louise requires specific country, we can also provide that information.
