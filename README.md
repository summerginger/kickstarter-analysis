# **kickstarter-analysis**
## Overview of Project
This report consists of two main campaign visualization outcomes based on Launch date and funding goals. 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis here is to discover how different campaigns fared based on Launch date and funding goals outcomes for Louise, so she can be more prepared before launching her new business idea.  
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The chart clear illustrate two things. For one, we can see that successful campaigns have much higher fundraising goals in the early months of the year and reached the peak in May. Then it was gradually decreasing towards the end of the year. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

By reviewing this line chat, we can see that there is a completely symmetrical relationship between successful and failed outcomes based on their goals. And it happens at 50% threshold. Overall, the lower amount of goal outcome, the higher the proportion of the successful projects, and vice versa.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Since the result of outcomes for both successful and failed campaigns complete the opposite, it could be hard to tell what else the factor was there to keep people unsuccessful from their projects. In addition, the percentage applied in outcomes based on goals hinders the actual number; for example, the number of goal outcomes (148) in the less amount range ( 1,000-4,999) was far greater than the outcomes (2) in the much higher range of amount (40,000-44,999) in successful projects. Yet, the percentage shows only a 10% difference between the two.

## Recommandation and Limitation
Based on the findings, we could recommend that the best time for Louise to launch her play should probably happen at the beginning of the year. However,there is a limitation need to be aware, which is the amount of goal outcome might not be the only reference due to the inflation and currency rates in all different countries over the years between 2009-2017. To make a better decision, We probably also need to look at measures of central tendency to see how the data is distributed. The following chart is based on U.S, therefore, If Louise requires specific country to launch her business, we can also provide that information.
